# rosbot_arduino

Clone this repo into your Arduino folder...

On Linux this is usually ~/Arduino/.

On Mac this is usually: <user>/Documents/Arduino/.

On Windows this is usually: C:/Users/<username>/Documents/Arduino/.

It will create folders for each of the sketches and shouldn't disrupt any existing folders/Sketches you already have.
